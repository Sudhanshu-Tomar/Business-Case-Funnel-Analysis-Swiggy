Swiggy is one of the largest food eCommerce platform in the country. Every day more than 1 million users are transacting on the platform. Let’s say you are growth and strategy analyst of Swiggy and you need to generate insight on the company’s performance in 2019. For this, you are going to use the ‘Funnel Case Study Data’ workbook which has 3 worksheets. 
You can find the details of the sheets below:

Session Details sheet has date wise session count. You can find listing sessions, menu sessions, cart sessions, payment sessions and order sessions day over day

Channel wise traffic sheet has traffic (listing sessions) breakup at the date level.

Supporting Data sheet has other information at the date level which might help you solve the case. The description of the columns is written below



Task:

1. You need to identify the increase or decrease in the number of orders using Session Details sheet.
2. Identify date of highs and lows in the orders with respect to same day last week.
   - Hint: on weekends, Swiggy is getting extra orders naturally. Hence you might see so many highs.
    - Hint: You can ignore difference of less than 20% and above -20% from the same day last week. Hence you can define highs which are above 20% or lows below -20%.
3. Check if there is change in traffic as compared to same day last week
     - If there is change in traffic, identify the source of traffic change using Channel wise traffic sheet
4.Check if there is change in Overall Conversion as compared to previous dates
 -Break the overall conversion into smaller part in the following metrics, and create fresh columns on the following metrics in the Session Sheet
 
 
 - L2M
 
 - M2C

 - C2P

 - P2O

- Identify which one of the conversions is fluctuating
- Create hypotheses on what could be the possibility for fluctuation in conversions
- Validate the hypotheses using Supporting data
